                        <h2>Hi there!</h2>
                        <p>I'm a full-stack developer from Singapore. I enjoy making websites from the front-end and back-end and I also like to tackle difficult and challenging problems while programming. I'm also exploring other areas like data science and cybersecurity.</p>
                        <small>My interest with the IT industry started with taking O-Level Computing, where I learnt Python in 2022. I fell in love with it, and since then, I started to code to solve challenging and interesting problems. At Singapore Polytechnic, I took interest in full-stack web development and learnt many programming languages such as JavaScript and HTML. Now, I am a developer who develops creative websites and programs, whether it is for fun or projects.</small>

                            <p>For the Front-End Web Development Module, I made a website to commemorate Singapore Polytechnic's 70th anniversary. This website has been hailed by my classmates as outstanding and impressive. My lecturer has also stated that I outdone myself with this project.

                            <p>My CA2 project for Back-End Web Development involves making a website with back-end features, written in express.js. Over 70 endpoints were made throughout November to December 2024. From January to February 2025, the front-end was then written to make the project more interactive and easier to use. This project scored a distinction from School of Computing.
